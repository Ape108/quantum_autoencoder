- Circuit depth increased significantly after transpilation (359-898 gates)
  • Original circuit: ~50 gates
  • After mapping to hardware: 359-898 gates due to connectivity constraints
- Decoherence time (T1, T2) limitations:
  • Hardware coherence time: ~100μs
  • Circuit execution time: ~50-70μs
  • Quantum state degraded before completion
- Hardware noise accumulation:
  • Each additional gate introduces 0.1-1% error
  • Multiplicative effect over 359+ gates
  • Results in exponential fidelity decay
- Final hardware fidelity: 0.5-11% depending on error mitigation

3. Error Mitigation Analysis
