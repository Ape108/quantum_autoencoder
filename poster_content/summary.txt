Conclusions:

1. Successfully demonstrated quantum autoencoder concept in simulation, achieving >99% fidelity for compressing a 5-qubit domain wall state into a 3-qubit latent space.

2. Implementation on IBM Quantum hardware revealed fundamental NISQ-era challenges:
   - Circuit transpilation increased gate count by ~10x due to hardware connectivity
   - Decoherence effects dominated as circuit execution approached coherence time
   - Gate errors accumulated exponentially with circuit depth
   - Even with error mitigation, hardware fidelity limited to 11%

3. The project provides valuable insights for quantum algorithm implementation:
   - Hardware-aware circuit design is crucial from the start
   - Transpilation impact must be considered in initial design
   - Error mitigation alone cannot overcome fundamental hardware limitations
   - Need for new architectures suited to NISQ constraints

Future Directions:
- Develop shallow circuit variants of quantum autoencoders
- Investigate hardware-specific optimization techniques
- Explore adaptive error mitigation strategies
- Research alternative compression architectures suitable for NISQ devices
