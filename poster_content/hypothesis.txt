Research Questions:

1. Can we effectively implement a quantum autoencoder using Qiskit Runtime V2 primitives that achieves high-fidelity compression of a 5-qubit domain wall state into a 3-qubit latent space?

2. How does the performance of our quantum autoencoder compare between ideal simulation and real quantum hardware execution?

3. What impact do error mitigation techniques (dynamical decoupling, resilience levels) have on the autoencoder's performance on real quantum hardware?

Expected Outcomes:
- Achieve >90% fidelity in ideal simulation
- Demonstrate successful compression on IBM Quantum hardware with error mitigation
- Establish a framework for quantum data compression using modern Qiskit primitives
