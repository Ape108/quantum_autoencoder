The files in this directory are from the [QuantumCircuitAutoencoder](https://github.com/qiaoyi213/QuantumCircuitAutoencoder.git) repository by [@qiaoyi213](https://github.com/qiaoyi213), which was created for the Qiskit Hackathon Taiwan 2023.

These files served as inspiration and reference for our improved implementation, particularly for:
- U-V encoder architecture
- Parameter optimization approach
- Circuit structure
